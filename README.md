# one-hot-encoded-data
<br>
this notebook contains code for encoding categorical features as a one-hot numerical array.<br>
one hot encoding can be defined as the essential process of converting the categorical data variables<br>
to be provided to machine and deep learning algorithms which in turn improve predictions as well as classification<br>
accuracy of a model.
